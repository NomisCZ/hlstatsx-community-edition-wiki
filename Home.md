Welcome to the wiki for HLStatsX: Community Edition, more commonly known as HLXCE. HLXCE is an open-source project which accepts log files in the HL Log Standard format, stores them in a MySQL database and then provides in-game and web-based ranking statistics. HLXCE utilizes many standard technologies available on many shared hosting platforms which gives all communities the ability to provide statistics for their players.
